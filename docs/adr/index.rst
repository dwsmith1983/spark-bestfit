Architecture Decision Records
=============================

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture the key architectural decisions
made during the development of spark-bestfit. Each ADR documents the context,
decision, and consequences of a significant design choice.

ADRs are numbered sequentially and remain in the repository even if superseded,
providing a historical record of how the architecture evolved.
